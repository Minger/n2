Description
====

Newscloud misc dependencies, cookbook based off opscode template.

Right now this installs:

  * curl and libcurl libs
  * libssl dependencies

This cookbook could be split out into individual components, but for the time
being, its convenient to have it all here in one place.

Requirements
====

Debian, Ubuntu
